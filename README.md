My take on the Advent of Code challenge.

## Dec 1st: C
📚C Programming Language *(Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie)*

## Dec 2nd: Lisp
💡You can find information [here](https://lisp-lang.org/learn/getting-started/) about how to download and get started with Lisp.

Start the sbcl shell and run using the following command:

```lisp
(load "puzzle2-step1.lisp")
(start)
```

## Dec 3rd: PHP
