# 🎄 Advent of Code 2019 🎄
My take on the Advent of Code challenge.

## Dec 1st: C
🔍First appeared 1972. Imperative (procedural), structured. Influenced e.g. C++, Java, PHP, C#.

📚C Programming Language *(Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie)*

## Dec 2nd: Lisp
🔍First appeared 1958. Functional, procedural, reflective, meta. Influenced e.g. Erlang, Prolog, Forth, Haskell.

💡You can find information [here](https://lisp-lang.org/learn/getting-started/) about how to download and get started with Lisp.

Start the sbcl shell and run using the following command:

```lisp
(load "puzzle2-step1.lisp")
(start)
```

## Dec 3rd: PHP
🔍First appeared 1995. Imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural, reflective.

## Dec 4th: Smalltalk (Squeak)
🔍First appeared 1972 (Squeak in 1996). Object-oriented with its own virtual machine, on which the code can be changed while the program is running.

💡Squeak can be [downloaded here](https://squeak.org/) and there is an outstanding aide-memoire to be found [here](https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/5699).

## Dec 5th: Scala
🔍First appeared 2004. Functional, imperative, object-oriented.

A Scala tutorial can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm)

## Dec 6th: Julia
