# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄
Here's my take on the Advent of Code challenge. Instead of choosing "the right tool for the job", I decided to take the opportunity of solving the problem using different programming languages.

Some of the programming languages I know by heart, others I had never tried and barely seen before this challenge. And some occasions were definitely a case of "the absolutely wrong tool for the job". So there's a BIG disclosure regarding code quality... 🙈🙈🙈

## 2018

### Dec 1st 2018: Golang
🔍First appeared 2009. Concurrent, functional, imperative, object-oriented.

### Dec 2th 2018: Elixir
🔍First appeared 2011. Functional, concurrent, distributed. Inspired by Ruby, Erlang, and Clojure. Builds on top of Erlang and is running on the BEAM.

💡Elixir comes with a detailed and well-written [documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir)

### Dec 3th 2018: Swift
🔍First appeared 2014. General-purpose, multi-paradigm. Influenced by e.g. Objective-C, Python, Haskell.

## 2019

### Dec 1st 2019: C
🔍First appeared 1972. Imperative (procedural), structured. Influenced e.g. C++, Java, PHP, C#.

📚C Programming Language *(Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie)*

### Dec 2nd 2019: Lisp
🔍First appeared 1958. Functional, procedural, reflective, meta. Influenced e.g. Erlang, Prolog, Forth, Haskell.

💡You can find information [here](https://lisp-lang.org/learn/getting-started/) about how to download and get started with Lisp.

Start the sbcl shell and run using the following command:

```lisp
(load "puzzle2-step1.lisp")
(start)
```

### Dec 3rd 2019: PHP
🔍First appeared 1995. Imperative, functional, object-oriented, procedural.

### Dec 4th 2019: Smalltalk (Squeak)
🔍First appeared 1972 (Squeak in 1996). Object-oriented with its own virtual machine, on which the code can be changed while the program is running.

💡Squeak can be [downloaded here](https://squeak.org/) and there is an outstanding aide-memoire to be found [here](https://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/5699).

### Dec 5th 2019: Scala
🔍First appeared 2004. Functional, imperative, object-oriented. Running on the JVM.

💡A Scala tutorial can be found [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm)

### Dec 6th 2019: Julia
🔍First appeared 2012. Procedural, functional.

### Dec 8th 2019: Ruby
🔍First appeared 1995. Functional, imperative, object-oriented.

### Dec 9th 2019: Erlang
🔍First appeared 1986. Concurrent, functional.

### Dec 10th 2019: Lua
🔍First appeared 1993. Imperative, functional.

💡Lua can be tried online [here](https://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo)

### Dec 12th 2019: Java
🔍First appeared 1995. Object-oriented (class-based), imperative.

### Dec 14th 2019: JavaScript
🔍First appeared 1995. Event-driven, functional, imperative, object-oriented.

### Dec 16th 2019: Haskell
🔍First appeared 1990. Functional.

### Dec 18th 2019: Prolog (work in progress)
💡SWI Prolog can be tried online [here](https://swish.swi-prolog.org)

### Dec 22th 2019: Python
🔍First appeared 1990. Functional, imperative, object-oriented, reflective.

### Dec 24th 2019: C#
🔍First appeared 2000. Structured, imperative, object-oriented, event-driven, task-driven, functional, generic, reflective, concurrent.
